So who am i you might wonder?

My name is Tomas Marx-Raacz von Hidv√©g, I am 38 years old father of one very energetic three year old.
I am half swedish and half hungarian, and the latter is the reason for the long and complicated surname.
As a current occupation i serve as a night time correctional officer and emergancy chief at a jail in Stockholm.

This education is my way out of that occupation which in more ways than one is slowly killing the soul.
This is not my first time around the school bench however as i have a Masters degree in Archaeological science.
